# ISAPRS<br>
Information Security Awareness Profiling &amp; Recommendation System<br>
## Introduction<br><br>
ISAPRS is a combination of profiling system and recommendation system that designed to:<br>
- Automate the ISA measurement process without a questionnaire to avoid Hawthorne effect, reduce the time comsume and man-power. 
- Keep the result of ISA measurement up-to-date and reflect the vulnerability on ISA.
- Profile the users according to their ISA result. (The profiles will be utilized for RS later.)
- To provide suitable security recommendations to users to increase their willingness of to apply for security practice.<br>(Ambiguous and complicated security warnings may disuade people from applying security protection.)
